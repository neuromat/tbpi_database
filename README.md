# A Public Database on Traumatic Brachial Plexus Injury

## About the database

The Brazilian public database on TBPI (TBPI-DB) is an initiative aimed at encouraging clinical data sharing and reuse. Data from 170 Brazilian adult TBPI patients with varying degrees of functional impairment was collected. 

## Data organization 

The dataset is organized in directories with plain-text files containing textual and numeric data that can be opened with a large variety of computational tools, from simple text editors to general-purpose statistical software. In all the .CSV files of the dataset, values (fields) in each line are separated by commas (,), textual values are enclosed by quotation marks (""), and the first file line contains the column titles (i.e., the descriptions of fields).
