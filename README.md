# A Public Database on Traumatic Brachial Plexus Injury

## About the database

This database is centered on adult traumatic brachial plexus injury (TBPI). TBPI mainly affects young males usually involved in motorcycle accidents, often leading to severe motor and sensory impairment in the affected upper limb. This initiative aimed at encouraging data sharing and reuse. Managing data from TBPI may allow the identification of functional markers related to patients' clinical improvement and foster the development of new investigative tools to elucidate its mechanisms. 

## Data description 

Detailed electronic questionnaires were designed to collect patients' epidemiological, physical, and clinical data. The free software Neuroscience Experiments System (NES) was employed to support data storage and management. Hence, data from 170 Brazilian adult TBPI patients with varying degrees of functional impairment was collected. The Unified Admission Assessment (Q44071_unified-admission-assessment) was devised to register the first patient evaluation by the TBPI research group. The Unified Follow-up Assessment (Q92510_unified-follow-up-assessment) was devised to register subsequent follow-up visits. The Unified Surgery Assessment (Q61802_unified-surgical-evaluation) was devised to register the surgical procedures employed for brachial plexus reconstruction. Data collection occurred between 2014 and 2020.
