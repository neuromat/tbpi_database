Study: Public Traumatic Brachial Plexus Injury Database (TBPI-DB).
Study description: TBPI-DB contains data from 170 patients.
Inclusion criteria:  ICD10: S14.3 - Injury of brachial plexus.
Data collect: NES registration, Unified Admission Assessment (Q44071_unified-admission-assessment), Unified Follow-up Assessment (Q92510_unified-follow-up-assessment) and Unified Surgery Assessment (Q61802_unified-surgical-evaluation). The questionnaires intend to explore general topics on TBPI considering the literature on the theme and the research team's professional experience in the field.
Questionnaires' description: 
	-Unified Admission Assessment (Q44071_unified-admission-assessment): register the first patient evaluation by the TBPI research group. It records information about past musculoskeletal injuries, TBPI injury (side, causes, type, and associated lesions), ongoing treatments (physiotherapy, orthosis, medication), and a detailed neurological exam that includes visual inspection (glenohumeral subluxation, scoliosis, Horner syndrome, upper limb swelling, upper limb scares, and upper limb trophic changes), a search for Tinel sign, sensory evaluation (light touch, pin prick, joint position sense, kinesthesia, and pallesthesia), motor evaluation (passive range of motion and muscle strength), and pain presence. The BP injury type considers different and hierarchical sources of information: surgical descriptions, complementary exams, previous notes and physical examinations.
		-Number of repetitions: 1.
		-Questionnaire completion: 170 patients - 170 completed fills.
	-Unified Follow-up Assessment (Q92510_unified-follow-up-assessment): registers subsequent follow-up visits and reviews ongoing non-surgical treatments and physical exams previously recorded on the Unified Admission Assessment.
		-Number of repetitions: Unlimited.
		-Questionnaire completion: 103 patients - 307 completed fills.
	-Unified Surgery Assessment (Q61802_unified-surgical-evaluation): register the surgical procedures employed for BP reconstruction. Surgical findings (level and type of lesion) and procedures (type of surgery with its specificities) were recorded.
		-Number of repetitions: Unlimited.
		-Questionnaire completion: 108 patients - 134 completed fills.
Sample characterization:
	Among the 170 patients, 144 were men (84.71%), and 26 were women (15.29%). The mean age upon TBPI was 32 years (standard deviation of 11 years), with half of the patients being younger than 29 years. The youngest patient was 15 years old at the time of injury, and the oldest patient was 68 years old. There was no side where the injury was predominant. Left-sided injuries occurred in 86 patients (50.59%), right-sided injuries occurred in 83 patients (48.82%), and bilateral injuries occurred in 1 patient (0.59%).
	Complete and upper trunk lesions predominated in the 170 TBPI-DB patients (Figure 1). Six patients presented with more than one type of lesion: one patient with bilateral TBPI with a left complete lesion and a right not informed or not accessed lesion; two patients with lesions in the right upper trunk and terminal branches; one patient with lesions in the left medial cord and posterior division; one patient with lesions in the left lower trunk and medial cord; and one patient with lesions in the left upper and lower trunk.
	Motorcycle accidents were the most reported cause of injury (Figure 2). Six patients reported more than one etiology for TBPI: one patient with a left lesion caused by a motorcycle accident and by a pedestrian vs. vehicle accident; one patient with a right lesion caused by sharp laceration or a blunt wound; one patient with a right lesion caused by a motorcycle and a surgical wound; one patient with a right lesion caused by an occupational accident and a sharp laceration/blunt wound; one patient with a right lesion caused by a motorcycle and a sharp laceration/blunt wound; and one patient with a right lesion caused by stretching and an occupational accident.
	More than half of the 170 TBPI-DB patients reported other traumatic injuries. Among the 170 TBPI-DB patients, 55.29% had fractures (94 patients), 47.06% had traumatic brain injury (80 patients), 6.47% had vascular injury (11 patients), and 2.94% had spinal cord injury (5 patients). Given that each patient could have more than one associated fracture with a TBPI event, 172 fracture sites were reported. The most common sites were the upper limb (25.58%), lower limb (16.28%), and clavicle (12.79%).
	BP reconstructive surgery status was as follows: 132 patients (77.6%) underwent surgery (with available data about procedure type for 108 of them); 6 patients (3.5%) did not undergo any surgery, and no surgical information was available for 32 patients (18.8%). The most frequent surgery was nerve transfer, which was performed in 101 patients (59,4%). The most common branch was from the fascicle of the ulnar nerve to the biceps motor branch of the musculocutaneous nerve (Oberlin nerve transfer), which occurred in 54 patients (31,8%). The time range from injury to surgery varied between 2.2 and 23.8 months, with half of the surgeries occurring up to 6.8 months after TBPI.
